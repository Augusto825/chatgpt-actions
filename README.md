# chatgpt-action

Let chatgpt review your PR.

Please noteï¼š this repo is a WIP and I do not recommend you to use it in production!

## Ideas

- Create a vscode extension that asks ChatGPT to refactor or point out the bugs of a selected range of code. I don't have time to learn vscode extension and implement it.
- Implement ChatGPT's review feedback as a commit or suggested change ([#27](https://github.com/kxxt/chatgpt-action/issues/27))

## Warning

- code of experimental quality!
- ChatGPT often generates misleading comments which could confuse your contributors and that's
one reason against using this action in production.
- Sometimes you will get 403 errors when the generated prompt is too long or considered an attack(perhaps?). 
  - ~~Split the prompt and let ChatGPT comment on every single file should resolve this issue most of the time.~~ 
  - This feature has been implemented but it is unstable. Add `split: true` to `with` node in your config to enable this feature.
    - When you have too many changed files, ChatGPT will produce very bad results. Here is an example: https://github.com/LearningOS/lab5-os8-kxxt/pull/1
